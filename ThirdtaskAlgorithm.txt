1. Import the necessary classes:
   
2. Define the `EmailValidator` class with a `main` method and a static method `isValidEmail` for email validation.

3. Inside the `main` method:
   - Create a `Scanner` object to read user input.
   - Prompt the user to enter an email address.
   - Read the input email.
   - Close the `Scanner` object.

4. Call the `isValidEmail` method with the provided email  argument.

5. The `isValidEmail` method:
   - Defines a regular expression `regex` for email validation.
   - Compiles the regular expression pattern using `Pattern.compile`.
   - Creates a `Matcher` object with the input email and the compiled pattern.
   - Uses the `matcher.matches()` method to check if the entire input email matches the pattern.
   - Returns `true` if the email is valid according to the pattern, otherwise returns `false`.

6. Finally, based on the result of `isValidEmail`, the program prints "Valid" or "Invalid" to the console.

7.The regular expression `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*@[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)+$` checks for the following:
   - The email must start with a letter (a-zA-Z).
   - After the first letter, it can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
   - There must be an "@" symbol.
   - After the "@" symbol, there must be at least one letter or digit.
   - There can be one or more groups of a period followed by letters/digits.
